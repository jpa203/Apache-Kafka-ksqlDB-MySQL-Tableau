# kakfa_streaming_project
A data engineering project using Apache Kafka, Confluent Platform, Python, kSQLDB, MySQL and Tableau


## Project Outline

This project aims to mimick a real-life data engineering project by ingesting real-time flight data at Boston Logan International Airport from a REST API, 
conducting some transformations in kSQLDB and loading results into a data mart in mySQL for downstream analysis using Tableau. 

## About Apache Kafka



## Key Takeaways


## Next Steps

I had also experimented launching this whole project on the cloud using an Amazon EC2 instance. However, the free tier t2.micro instance is unequipped to handle Confluent Platform due to 
its limited resources and thus a bigger machine would be required to carry out this task.
